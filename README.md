# Client_Server_Chat

## Summary

This is a barebones client and server application implemeneted mostly from scratch. **the pain.c file is not mine** but the python files are. below are screenshots of the working solution.

## How to Run

1) Run “python server.py” (DO NOT QUIT PROGRAM)
2) Run “python client.py” (ON NEW TERMINAL)
3) Finally the client should display “CONNECTION SUCCESSFUL” and the server should
say the client is connected to your address.
4) You will now be able to send messages to the client and server. Make sure you send a
message to the client first then the server next and so on and so on

## Project 4 – Client / Server Chat

Introduction
In this coding project you will write a simple client-server program using python sockets. 
Your program will emulate a simple chat client. For extra-credit (points tbd), turn your 
chat program into a simple ascii multiplayer game (see below for spec).
Writing a client-server socket program
This chat client-server is fairly simple in design. The server doesn’t handle multiple 
clients, and there is only one socket connection made. You will reuse this socket for the 
life of the program. The one issue with reusing sockets is that there is no easy way to tell 
when you’ve received a complete communication:
“… if you plan to reuse your socket for further transfers, you need to realize that there is 
no EOT (end of transmission) on a socket. I repeat: if a socket send or recv returns after 
handling 0 bytes, the connection has been broken. If the connection has not been 
broken, you may wait on a recv forever, because the socket will not tell you that there’s 
nothing more to read (for now). Now if you think about that a bit, you’ll come to realize 
a fundamental truth of sockets: messages must either be fixed length (yuck), or be 
delimited (shrug), or indicate how long they are (much better), or end by shutting down 
the connection. The choice is entirely yours, (but some ways are righter than others).”

Note that in the process of testing, you can “hang” a port. This will give an error when 
you start the server: [Errno 48] Address already in use. Don’t worry, the ports will 
recycle eventually.
There are several ways around this, including simply specifying a different port every 
time you run. A good alternative, that mostly works, is to set a socket reuse option before 
the bind command on the server: s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
Specification

## Server

1. The server creates a socket and binds to ‘localhost’ and port xxxx
2. The server then listens for a connection
3. When connected, the server calls recv to receive data
4. The server prints the data, then prompts for a reply
5. If the reply is /q, the server quits
6. Otherwise, the server sends the reply
7. Back to step 3
8. Sockets are closed (can use with in python3)

## Client
1. The client creates a socket and connects to ‘localhost’ and port xxxx
2. When connected, the client prompts for a message to send
3. If the message is /q, the client quits
4. Otherwise, the client sends the message
5. The client calls recv to receive data
6. The client prints the data
7. Back to step 2
8. Sockets are closed (can use with in python3)
(A better spec might just be to show example screenshots)

## What to turn in
1. In the Word doc:
a. Include instructions on how to run your programs. Are they python3? 
b. Include screenshots of your running code.
c. Include comments / questions (optional)
2. In your code listings:
a. Include sources you used (web pages, tutorials, books, etc)
b. Comment your code

## Extra Credit

Turn your client-server into a multiplayer ascii game. Tic-tac-toe? Hangman? The choice 
is up to you. Points awarded subjectively based on effort. Max points possible tbd.
